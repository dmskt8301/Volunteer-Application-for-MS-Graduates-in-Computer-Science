# Volunteer Application

Welcome to the Volunteer Application Project! This project aims to create a user-friendly web application to manage volunteer programs for MS graduates in Computer Science.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
To get started with the project, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Copy the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Install dependencies using npm:

### `npm i --legacy-peer-deps`

4. In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
This will generate a production-ready build of the application in the `build` directory.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
